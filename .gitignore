# Docker-specific ignores
# Docker Compose often creates a .env file for environment variables
# If you use a .env file for sensitive data (like API keys, DB passwords), ignore it.

# Database-specific ignores
# The postgres_data volume is managed by Docker, but if any local files
# were created outside of the container for DB, they should be ignored.
# In this setup, the data is inside the Docker volume, so no direct local files.
